# Description

This repository contains the signature key to a virtual machine as part of the Born2BeRoot project.
This project consists of creating a virtual machine, setting up an OS and implementing strict rules.

# Instructions

First, compare the signature key present in the repository.
To do so, open the default installation folder and go to the VM's folder :
`~/VirtualBox VMs/foobar_vm/`

Then, retrieve the signature of the VM from the ".vdi" file, in sha1 format :
`sha1sum foobar_serv.vdi`

This is an exemple output :
